\textbf{Computer Tutorial 4: The Factor Augmented VAR}
\end{center}

\bigskip 

I\ have provided Matlab code which estimates the Factor Augmented VAR model
of Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz\ (2005, QJE) where the factors are
approximated by Principal Components. The code produces impulse responses.
Experiment with this code (i.e. change the prior, lag length or number of
factors)\ to see if results are robust and to gain experience in Bayesian
FAVAR\ modelling. 

Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz isolate a single variable, the interest rate, in
the FAVAR. The code provided isolates three (the interest rate, the
unemployment rate and inflation). Note also that the identification scheme
used by Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz divides the variables into
\textquotedblleft slow moving\textquotedblright\ (i.e. those which do not
react quickly to a monetary policy shock) and \textquotedblleft fast
moving\textquotedblright\ (those which do) and I\ have followed their
recommendations in the code.
