\textbf{Computer Tutorial 5: TVP-VARs and Multivariate Stochastic Volatility
in VARs}
\end{center}

Run the code in the file \textquotedblleft TVP\_FAVAR.m\textquotedblright\
which estimates a Financial Conditions Index as in Koop and Korobilis
(2014). A New Index of Financial Conditions, European Economic Review. Note
that this code estimates a single TVP-FAVAR model. Examine its features such
as evolution of the factor loadings and volatilities. 

The package of code provided contains various other programs. These for the
estimation of various versions of this model including the DMA\ approach
used in Koop and Korobilis (2014). This averages over many different
TVP-VAVARs in a dynamic fashion. It is unlikely that you will have time to
use these codes since I did not discuss DMA in the lectures. But I provide
the code just in case you are interested in using these methods in the
future.
